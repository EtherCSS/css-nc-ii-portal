        "Today is our practical demonstration on server management. " +
        "In this session, we will explore how to configure and manage servers effectively. " +
        "First, it is important to assign a static IP address to ensure reliable communication across the network. " +
        "Second, we must configure user accounts and permissions to keep resources secure. " +
        "Third, we will discuss installing server roles, such as file services for data sharing, " +
        "web services for hosting websites, and domain controller roles for centralized management. " +
        "We will also cover DHCP and DNS roles, which are essential for assigning IP addresses and resolving host names automatically. " +
        "Always remember that proper backup and recovery plans are crucial for server reliability. " +
        "Finally, we will emphasize monitoring, security updates, and regular maintenance to ensure that the server stays stable and secure. " +
        "By the end of this lesson, you will understand the key responsibilities in configuring and maintaining a server for professional use.";
